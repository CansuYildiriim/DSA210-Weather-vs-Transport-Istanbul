# Understanding the Relationship Between Weather, Major Events, and Public Transportation Usage in Istanbul

## Motivation
This project aims to explore how daily weather conditions (such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity) and major events (such as football match days) affect public transportation usage in Istanbul. 

Understanding these relationships can help city planners and transportation authorities design more efficient, responsive, and sustainable systems — especially under dynamic conditions like match-day traffic surges or rainy rush hours.

## Data Sources
- **Weather Data:** Daily weather observations (temperature, rainfall, humidity) from the Turkish State Meteorological Service (MGM).  
- **Transportation Data:** Daily passenger counts from Istanbul Electricity, Tramway and Tunnel General Management (IETT) Open Data Portal.  
- **Major Events Data:** Dates of major football matches in Istanbul from the Turkish Football Federation (TFF).  
  - Each day is marked as `1` (match day) or `0` (no match day).

## Project Goals
1. Identify correlations between weather conditions and passenger counts.
2. Compare transportation usage between match and non-match days.
3. Explore how weather amplifies or reduces the match-day impact.
4. Visualize trends using Python data analysis and visualization libraries.
